### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Naveen Wijesinghe from Sri Lanka, I am a 2nd-year student currently studying for a degree in Networking and Mobile Computing.I'm especially interested in Cyber Security - Networking - Hacking. This is one more thing, I'm more interested in art and philosophy. Sounds a little different, doesn't it?
